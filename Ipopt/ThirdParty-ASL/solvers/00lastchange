  solvers2.tgz:  fix some bugs in parallel evaluations; new
possibilities for doing Hessian evaluation and/or sparsity
determination in parallel, controlled by new values in psinfo.h:

	int hesevalth;	/* number of threads for sphes_ew_ASL */
	int hessetupth;	/* number of threads for sphes_setup_ew_ASL */
	int hesvecth;	/* number of threads for Hessian-vector products */
	int sph_opts;	/* options affecting threaded sphes and sphes_setup */

Partially separable structure: Hessian is the sum of products
		matrix-transpose * internal Hessian * matrix.

Current sph_opts bits:
	1 = assume internal Hessians are dense
	2 = print dimensions internal Hessians
	4 = suppress parallel setup for Hessian evaluations
	8 = suppress parallel Hessian evaluations
	16 = 0x10 = print number of threads for setting up Hessian evaluations
	32 = 0x20 = print number of threads for doing Hessian evaluations
	64 = 0x40 = print number of threads used for Hessian-vector products
	128 = 0x80 = suppress parallel Hessian-vector products
	256 = 0x100 = allow parallel evaluation of internal Hessians
			used in Hessian-vector products.  The default is not
			to do this in parallel because it slows evaluations
			on a large example.

Note that parallel Hessian evaluations are not available in solvers.tgz.
